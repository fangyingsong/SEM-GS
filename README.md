# This code can be used for solving 2D Gray-Scott equation. 
# We use spectral element method for spatical discretization. 
# We use second-order CN scheme for temperal discretization. 
# This demo includes two examaple "main_turb_accruate" and "math_turb_experiment".
# If you have any questions please let me know.
